Data-Driven control overcomes the dependence of model for synthesis using any learning method or identification technique. It is known that Koopman operator can represent the behavior of a nonlinear system using observables. A finite approximation based on data of the composition operator can be achieved using the EDMD algorithm with a given dictionary. We propose a moving horizon estimation and an MPC algorithm based on EDMD on-line. With this method, we have a better approximation of the system in each sampling time, and we can do state estimation and control in real-time. Additionally, we present a sub-optimal strategy based on off-line SVD which reduces the computational burden with minimal degradation on performance. We test the proposed method by numerical examples.
